    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Task Communication Pattern** using the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** - an open standard that enables one agent to delegate work to another agent by creating and managing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Task Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Task Pattern** is a communication approach where:\n",
    "- One agent (the **delegator**) creates a task for another agent (the **worker**)\n",
    "- The worker agent processes the task independently\n",
    "- The worker updates the task with results/artifacts when complete\n",
    "- Communication happens asynchronously via task status and artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## A2A Protocol: An Implementation of the Task Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol**, introduced by Google, is a standardized HTTP-based implementation of the Task Pattern. It defines:\n",
    "- How to create tasks with specific goals\n",
    "- How agents communicate task status\n",
    "- How to exchange artifacts (results/data)\n",
    "- A standard message format for interoperability\n",
