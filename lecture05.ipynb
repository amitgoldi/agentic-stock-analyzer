    "# Lecture 05: Task Pattern (A2A)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Task Communication Pattern** using the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** - an open standard that enables one agent to delegate work to another agent by creating and managing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Task Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Task Pattern** is a communication approach where:\n",
    "- One agent (the **delegator**) creates a task for another agent (the **worker**)\n",
    "- The worker agent processes the task independently\n",
    "- The worker updates the task with results/artifacts when complete\n",
    "- Communication happens asynchronously via task status and artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## A2A Protocol: An Implementation of the Task Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol**, introduced by Google, is a standardized HTTP-based implementation of the Task Pattern. It defines:\n",
    "- How to create tasks with specific goals\n",
    "- How agents communicate task status\n",
    "- How to exchange artifacts (results/data)\n",
    "- A standard message format for interoperability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Pattern Architecture\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This diagram shows the **polling** approach. A2A also supports **streaming (SSE)** for real-time updates and **push notifications (webhooks)** for server-initiated callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "1. **Task Creation**: Agent 1 creates a task with a specific goal\n",
    "2. **Task Delegation**: A2A protocol delivers the task to Agent 2\n",
    "3. **Task Processing**: Agent 2 works on the task independently\n",
    "4. **Task Updates**: Agent 2 updates task status during processing\n",
    "5. **Artifact Exchange**: Agent 2 attaches results as artifacts to the task\n",
    "6. **Task Completion**: Agent 1 retrieves the completed task with artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before running this notebook, start the A2A stock analysis server in a separate terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

      "Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a global leader in consumer electronics, software, and digital services, with a market capitalization around $4.1 trillion (as of January 2026). The company is underpinned by robust product sales (iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables), continued expansion into services (App Store, Apple TV+, iCloud), and a resilient brand. Apple consistently shows impressive profitability, high margins, and strong free cash flow, fueled by innovation in hardware, AI, AR/VR, and health tech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent News:\n",
      "- Strong holiday 2025 sales of iPhone and wearables.\n",
      "- Ongoing investment and innovation in AI, with rumors of new AR glasses in 2026.\n",
      "- Strategic partnerships in automotive and health sectors to expand ecosystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial Highlights:\n",
      "- Trailing P/E: 37.32; Earnings Per Share (EPS): $7.47\n",
      "- Dividend Yield: 0.37% ($1.04 per share, payout ratio 15.24%)\n",
      "- Net margin: ~27%, ROE: over 110%, free cash flow margins above 25%\n",
      "- Strong balance sheet and continued share buybacks\n",
      "\n",
      "Market Sentiment:\n",
      "Sentiment is positive, reflecting confidence in Apple’s innovation and ecosystem lock-in. However, some caution exists due to Apple's high valuation relative to its historical average and concerns about modest growth in mature hardware markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Factors:\n",
      "- High valuation may limit near-term upside.\n",
      "- Intense competition in devices, services, and AI.\n",
      "- Geopolitical and supply chain risks (notably in China).\n",
      "- Ongoing regulatory scrutiny, especially around the App Store and privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation:\n",
      "Apple is considered a core holding for long-term investors given its brand, innovation, and financial strength. However, new investors are advised to consider buying during market pullbacks rather than at current record highs due to valuation and external risks.\n",
