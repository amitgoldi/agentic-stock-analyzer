    "# Lecture 05: Task Pattern (A2A)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Task Communication Pattern** using the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** - an open standard that enables one agent to delegate work to another agent by creating and managing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Task Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Task Pattern** is a communication approach where:\n",
    "- One agent (the **delegator**) creates a task for another agent (the **worker**)\n",
    "- The worker agent processes the task independently\n",
    "- The worker updates the task with results/artifacts when complete\n",
    "- Communication happens asynchronously via task status and artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## A2A Protocol: An Implementation of the Task Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol**, introduced by Google, is a standardized HTTP-based implementation of the Task Pattern. It defines:\n",
    "- How to create tasks with specific goals\n",
    "- How agents communicate task status\n",
    "- How to exchange artifacts (results/data)\n",
    "- A standard message format for interoperability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Pattern Architecture\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This diagram shows the **polling** approach. A2A also supports **streaming (SSE)** for real-time updates and **push notifications (webhooks)** for server-initiated callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "1. **Task Creation**: Agent 1 creates a task with a specific goal\n",
    "2. **Task Delegation**: A2A protocol delivers the task to Agent 2\n",
    "3. **Task Processing**: Agent 2 works on the task independently\n",
    "4. **Task Updates**: Agent 2 updates task status during processing\n",
    "5. **Artifact Exchange**: Agent 2 attaches results as artifacts to the task\n",
    "6. **Task Completion**: Agent 1 retrieves the completed task with artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before running this notebook, start the A2A stock analysis server in a separate terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

The company is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and new product categories, which supports its long-term growth prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent News Highlights:\n",
      "- Apple projects 10%-12% revenue growth in Q1 2026, led by iPhone sales.\n",
      "- Record FY2025 revenue: $416 billion, the highest in Apple’s history.\n",
      "- Analyst consensus for 2026: Moderate buy, with target prices between $299 and $350.\n",
      "- Raymond James downgraded Apple to \"Market Perform\" due to high valuation and limited short-term upside.\n",
      "- Outperformed most AI stocks recently, but lags the S&P 500’s one-year return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial Highlights:\n",
      "- FY2025 revenue: $416 billion (Q4 YoY growth: +8%)\n",
      "- iPhone revenue up 6% YoY in the latest quarter, with record units sold.\n",
      "- Operating income: $130 billion (31.9% margin).\n",
      "- Net income: $99 billion (24.3% net margin).\n",
      "- Services and AI-driven offerings are the main growth drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Market Sentiment:\n",
      "Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with most analysts suggesting a moderate buy. Supporters point to Apple’s ongoing innovation and record cash flow, while skeptics highlight valuation, hardware market maturity, and regulatory risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Risk Factors:\n",
      "- High valuation could limit short-term upside.\n",
      "- Slower upgrade cycles as the smartphone market matures.\n",
      "- Growing regulatory scrutiny and potential antitrust issues.\n",
      "- Economic and supply chain uncertainties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation:\n",
      "Maintain a moderate buy or hold stance. Apple’s strong market position, cash flow, and expansion in services and AI provide resilience and growth opportunities. However, limited short-term upside and external risks mean new investors should be cautious.\n",
