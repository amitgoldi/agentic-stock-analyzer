    "\n",
    "The agent follows the **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) pattern, which combines reasoning and acting in an iterative loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    Start([👤 User Question 👤]) --> Reason[🤖 Agent: Analyze & Reason<br/>- Understand question<br/>- Plan approach<br/>- Decide on tools]\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: The agent analyzes the question and decides what actions to take\n",
    "- **Acting**: The agent calls tools (like web search) to gather information\n",
    "- **Iteration**: This process repeats until the agent has enough information (shown by the loop back from React to Decision)\n",
    "- **Reflection**: After each tool call, the agent reflects on the results and decides next steps\n"
