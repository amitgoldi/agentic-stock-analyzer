    "This notebook demonstrates a single AI agent that uses web search to analyze stocks and generate comprehensive reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: The agent uses Pydantic models (`StockReport`) to ensure responses follow a specific, validated schema\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: By specifying `output_type=StockReport`, the agent is guaranteed to return structured data with all required fields\n",
    "- **Web Search Integration**: The agent can search the web for real-time stock information to populate the report\n",
    "\n",
    "The `StockReport` model defines fields like `symbol`, `company_name`, `current_price`, `recommendation`, and more, ensuring consistent and predictable output from the AI agent.\n"
