    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Agent-as-Tool** collaboration paradigm, where one agent uses another specialized agent as a tool. The financial assistant from Lecture 01 is enhanced with a `stock_report` tool that internally delegates to the Lecture 02 stock analysis agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Agent-as-Tool Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This extends the ReAct pattern from Lecture 01 by adding multiple tool options. The agent now chooses between different tools based on the type of information needed:\n",

    "**Key Differences from Lecture 01:**\n",
    "- **Multiple Tools**: Agent now has 2 tools to choose from (web_search and stock_report)\n",
    "- **Tool Selection**: Additional decision node for choosing the appropriate tool\n",
    "- **Agent-as-Tool**: The stock_report tool is actually another agent (from Lecture 02) that runs independently\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Stock analysis returns typed `StockReport` objects instead of raw text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Specialized agents can be reused as tools by other agents\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on its specific domain\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Agents return structured Pydantic models ensuring data consistency\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The stock analysis agent can be used standalone or as a tool\n"
