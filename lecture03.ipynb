    "# Lecture 03: Agent-as-Tool Collaboration Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Agent-as-Tool** collaboration paradigm, where one agent uses another specialized agent as a tool. The financial assistant from Lecture 01 is enhanced with a `stock_report` tool that internally delegates to the Lecture 02 stock analysis agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Agent-as-Tool Works: Enhanced ReAct Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This extends the ReAct pattern from Lecture 01 by adding multiple tool options. The agent now chooses between different tools based on the type of information needed:\n",

    "**Key Differences from Lecture 01:**\n",
    "- **Multiple Tools**: Agent now has 2 tools to choose from (web_search and stock_report)\n",
    "- **Tool Selection**: Additional decision node for choosing the appropriate tool\n",
    "- **Agent-as-Tool**: The stock_report tool is actually another agent (from Lecture 02) that runs independently\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Stock analysis returns typed `StockReport` objects instead of raw text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Specialized agents can be reused as tools by other agents\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on its specific domain\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Agents return structured Pydantic models ensuring data consistency\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The stock analysis agent can be used standalone or as a tool\n"
