    "# Lecture 03: Agent-as-Tool Collaboration Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Agent-as-Tool** collaboration paradigm, where one agent uses another specialized agent as a tool. The financial assistant from Lecture 01 is enhanced with a `stock_report` tool that internally delegates to the Lecture 02 stock analysis agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Agent-as-Tool Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This extends the ReAct pattern from Lecture 01 by adding multiple tool options. The agent now chooses between different tools based on the type of information needed:\n",

    "**Key Differences from Lecture 01:**\n",
    "- **Multiple Tools**: Agent now has 2 tools to choose from (web_search and stock_report)\n",
    "- **Tool Selection**: Additional decision node for choosing the appropriate tool\n",
    "- **Agent-as-Tool**: The stock_report tool is actually another agent (from Lecture 02) that runs independently\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Stock analysis returns typed `StockReport` objects instead of raw text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Specialized agents can be reused as tools by other agents\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on its specific domain\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Agents return structured Pydantic models ensuring data consistency\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The stock analysis agent can be used standalone or as a tool\n"

       "### 1. Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR)\n",
       "- **Price (Dec 13, 2025):** \\$40.73\n",
       "- **Profile:** A real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in Southern California industrial properties.\n",
       "- **Fundamentals:** Q3 revenue \\$253.2M, Q3 EPS \\$0.37 (missed estimates). Net income for 9 months: \\$268.9M. Dividend yield ~4.1%. Occupancy solid at 89.2%.\n",
       "- **News:** CEO succession announced; insider selling by a top executive; new board appointment.\n",
       "- **Market Sentiment:** Neutral to slightly bearish. Analysts rate “Hold,” citing stable cash flows but caution due to earnings miss and sector headwinds.\n",
       "- **Risks:** Higher interest expenses, dilution risk, moderate occupancy decline from repositioning efforts.\n",
       "- **Recommendation:** A stable, income-focused option for long-term holders. Hold for now; dividend remains attractive. Limited short-term upside due to headwinds.\n",

       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. e.l.f. Beauty (ELF)\n",

       "- **News:** CEO sold shares this week; strong brand partnership results; recent earnings beat.\n",
       "- **Market Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning bullish. High growth and price targets, but recent pullback and insider selling spark caution.\n",
       "- **Risks:** Insider selling, steep price drop (down 42% from 2024 highs), rising competition, premium valuation, consumer spending trends.\n",
       "- **Recommendation:** Appears undervalued for long-term growth investors. Attractive if you tolerate volatility, but watch near-term risks.\n",

       "---\n",

       "- **News:** Major insider selling; widening quarterly losses; preparing for big franchise releases in 2026.\n",
       "- **Market Sentiment:** Cautious to negative. Bearish outlook due to ongoing losses, falling revenues, and insider selling.\n",
       "- **Risks:** Revenue decline, high debt, intense streaming competition, management confidence concerns.\n",
